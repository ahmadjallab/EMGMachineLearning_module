## EMG Feature Extraction

This project explains how to apply digital filters above a raw EMG signal and then extract time and frequency features using 
the sliding window method. This characterization can be used as input to train a machine learning model that recognizes muscular patterns.


### Prerequisites
You must have NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, and  Pyyawt installed.

### Project Structure

1. digital_processing.py - It contains the digital filters (notch and band pass) configuration to eliminate signal noise and artifacts.


### Running the project

1. Clone emg pattern recognition project in a local directory.
```

```

2. Create enviroment for run EMG pattern recognition project. In your cloned folder run the following commands:
```
virtualenv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pyyawt 
```
